    <h1>The Tournament</h1>

        <p>
          Though the first European Championship was held in 1960, the idea
          behind it is much older. It dates back to 1927, when the French
          Football Federation's administrator Henri Delaunay first proposed a
          pan-European football tournament. Despite the fact that he later
          became the first General Secretary of UEFA, Delaunay had already
          passed away by the time the tournament was officially started. In his
          honor, the tournament trophy was named after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Henri Delaunay trophy contains a figure of a juggling boy on the
          back and the words "Championnat d'Europe,” and "Coupe Henri Delaunay"
          on the front. In 2008, it was remodeled to make it larger and more in
          line with UEFA's more modern trophies. The new trophy is made of
          sterling silver, weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb), and is 60 centimeters (24
          in) tall. The names of the winning countries are now engraved on the
          back.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The two most successful nations in the tournament's history are
          Germany and Spain, with three titles each. Spain is the only nation to
          successfully defend its title, having done so in 2012. Germany has
          played the most matches (53), scored the most goals (75) and recorded
          the most victories (28). In 1984, France became the only nation to win
          all of its matches at a tournament (5 out of 5). In 1992, Denmark won
          the title with only two victories in five games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, the European Champions has gotten more popular with TV
          audiences. In 2016, the total live audience for the expanded 51-match
          tournament grew to 2 billion viewers. When compared to Euro 2012, this
          amounted to an increase of 100 million. These totals were mostly
          raised by audiences in Brazil and China, where the 1300 GMT slot had a
          big impact. The final match between Portugal and France attracted 600
          million people.

    <h3>Germany will be host to its 17th Edition</h3>

    <article class="germanyHost">
      <div>
        <p class="description">
          The euro 2024, will be the 17th edition of the UEFA European
          Championship, the quadrennial international football championship
          organised by UEFA for the men's national teams of its member
          associations. Germany will host the tournament, which is scheduled to
          take place from 14 June to 14 July 2024. It will be the third time
          that European Championship matches are played on German territory and
          the second time in reunified Germany as the former West Germany hosted
          the tournament of 1988, and four matches of the multi-national Euro
          2020 were played in Munich. It will be the first time the competition
          is held in the region of former East Germany with Leipzig as a host
          city, as well as the first time that a reunified Germany served as a
          solo host nation. The tournament will return to its usual four-year
          cycle, after Euro 2020 was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19
          pandemic. 24 teams will take part. Italy are the defending champions,
          having won the 2020 tournament after beating England on penalties in
          the final.

            <h4>Berlin</h4>
            <p>
              Germany's third largest metropolitan area, with a population of
              3.7 million, Berlin has been the nation's capital since
              reunification in 1990, and when it comes to culture, sport,
              fashion, architecture and nightlife, it can give London, Paris or
              New York a run for their money.

            <h4>Munich</h4>
            <p>
              Home to around 1.6 million people, Munich is Germany's third
              largest city. Due to its location close to the Alps and the nearby
              lakes, plus the generally laid-back lifestyle of its population,
              Munich has been labelled (with a sly wink) as the most northerly
              city in Italy.

            <h4>Cologne</h4>
            <p>
              A city with a history that stretches back over 2,000 years,
              Cologne sits on the River Rhine and is now home to over one
              million inhabitants. Locals are renowned for their cheerful,
              open-minded attitude, with that warmth evident during carnival
              season.

            <h4>Hamburg</h4>
            <p>
              The third biggest European city which is not a national capital,
              Hamburg (population 1.8 million) has a world-renowned harbour, a
              rich cultural history and plenty of beautiful old buildings, with
              its reputation for nightlife making it something of a 'bucket
              list' city for tourists.

            <h4>Stuttgart</h4>
            <p>
              Stuttgart (population: 640,000) is a major industrial city and
              home to two of the most famous car manufacturers in the world,
              Mercedes and Porsche. The mild climate and rich soil of the Neckar
              Valley mean the surrounding area produces some great wines too..

            <h4>Gelsenkirchen</h4>
            <p>
              In the heart of the industrial Ruhr district, Gelsenkirchen – with
              a population of 250,000 – was a city that owed its prosperity to
              coal mining and steelmaking (hence the nickname: 'City of a
              Thousand Fires'). It also produces great footballers, via local
              club Schalke 04, and has more to offer besides.

          <div>
            <h4>Leipzig</h4>
            <p>
              The most substantial city in Saxony, with a population of 600,000,
              Leipzig played a crucial role in German history. The peaceful,
              late-1989 Monday demonstrations in the East Germany city captured
              the mood as Germany moved toward reunification.

            <h4>Frankfurt</h4>
            <p>
              A global hub for commerce and finance, Frankfurt is home to one of
              the planet's busiest airports, German stock exchange and European
              Central Bank. Situated on the banks of the river Main, Germany's
              fifth largest city's distinct skyline has earned the nickname
              'Mainhattan'.

            <h4>Dortmund</h4>
            <p>
              Considered the cultural heart of the Ruhr region, Dortmund was
              known purely for coal, steel and beer 50 years ago, but has
              evolved into a major tech hub, with a state-of-the-art university
              and a lively cultural scene. Borussia Dortmund are pretty good
              too!

            <h4>Dusseldorf</h4>
            <p>
              The capital of North Rhine-Westphalia has 650,000 inhabitants,
              with Düsseldorf offering a broad array of leisure and cultural
              activities, as well as a fabulous infrastructure – one of the
              reasons that the quality of life in this part of Germany is rated
              so highly.
